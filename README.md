# Typescript Handbook Notes
This repo contains notes and code snippets for the TypeScript Handbook.
Tabs of the handbook are organized by folder.
Sections of the tabs are organized as separate files within the tab's folder.

You can visit the official TypeScript Handbook [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html).

## Installation
This project comes set up with TypeScript Execute (tsx). It's all you will really need
to run these files and see their output.

Execute `npx tsx <file_path_from_root>` in the command line to run TypeScript files. Alternatively, you can add them as scripts to package.json.
